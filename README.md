# Crowdfunding_ETL

Hi Peter,

this is my solution to Project 2.

In this repository you will find my jupiter notebook. For creating Contacts DataFrame I chose option 1, as I still need to go over regular expression classes in depth.

In the repository you will also find a folder Resources that contain all the excel files as well as csv files saved from jupiter notebook.
I also attached an ERD sketch for my DB, database schema file as well as file with some basic queries on the DB.

Thanks,

Katharina
